Help tool for Flight Factor A350 add on for X-Plane 11

This tool is originally made to generate SID/STAR files for FFA350.
Requires Python installed (developed with version 3.5.1)

Just launch flight_helper_cli.py and you will get simple CLI app.

Important thing is to change directories to match your installation (or modify script so it can read X-Plane 11 location from config file)

Also required navdata to be located in /X-Plane 11/Custom Data/GNS430/ folder.

Feel free to use this script for anything. Develop, distribute, sell etc.
